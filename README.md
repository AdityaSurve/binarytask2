## Features

1. **Fully Functional and Responsive Banking Website**
   
   Our banking website provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both customers and bankers. With its clean and intuitive interface, users can easily navigate through the various features and functionalities.

2. **Secure Authentication with JWT Tokens**
   
   Each time a customer or banker logs in, a secret JSON Web Token (JWT) is created, ensuring secure access to their accounts. These tokens automatically expire after 3 days (can be changed as per requirement), enhancing the overall security measures. Logging out removes the JWT immediately.

3. **Real-Time Balance Updates on Customer Dashboard**
   
   Customers can view their account balance on the dashboard, with instant updates reflecting deposits and withdrawals. This feature enables customers to manage their finances efficiently and stay informed about their account status.

4. **Transaction History for Bankers**
   
   Bankers have access to the comprehensive transaction history of all customers. This includes transaction details such as the transaction ID, customer ID, type of transaction (deposit or withdrawal), the corresponding amount, and the timestamp. This facilitates smooth record-keeping and provides a holistic view of banking activities.

5. **Enhanced Customer-Banker Relationship**
   
   The main page of our banking website provides additional information to enhance trust and transparency. Customers can access guidelines, location details, and more information about the bank. This feature aims to foster a strong relationship between customers and bankers.
